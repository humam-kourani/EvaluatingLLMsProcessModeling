An e-commerce companyâ€™s order fulfillment process involves several steps: Upon order placement, the system records details and processes payment. If payment fails, the customer is notified, ending the process. For successful payments, the inventory checks stock; if out of stock, a back-order is initiated, and the customer is informed of delays. When all items are available, warehouse staff pick, check quality, and package the order, including gift wrapping if requested. Shipping documents and labels are prepared, with customs forms for international orders. After packaging, the order is dispatched, and the system updates inventory and sends a shipping confirmation. Upon delivery, a feedback email is sent. If issues arise, the returns process begins, involving a return label, item inspection, and a refund or replacement.
