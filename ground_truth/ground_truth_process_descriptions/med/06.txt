The process starts when a customer places an order online or by phone. The system sends an order confirmation to the customer. The warehouse team picks and packs the items, generates a shipping label, and hands the order to a logistics provider. Tracking information is provided to the customer. The shipment is monitored until delivery, at which point the process concludes, though feedback or returns may prompt further actions.
