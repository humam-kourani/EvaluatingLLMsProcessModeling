The process begins when a company schedules a compliance audit for standards like ISO, safety, or environmental regulations. Internal teams prepare by gathering documentation, evidence, and conducting a self-assessment. Auditors then review the processes, identifying any gaps. After addressing corrections, the company undergoes a final audit. If compliant, certification is awarded, concluding with official document issuance.
