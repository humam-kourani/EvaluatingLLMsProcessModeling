The annual audit process begins when the audit coordinator notifies the regional office, which prepares financial statements and gathers documents. Meanwhile, the compliance team checks for regulatory updates. The regional office submits documents to the central audit team, which reviews them and requests clarifications if needed. Once clarified, a risk assessment is conducted, covering financial, operational, and compliance risks in any order. High-risk findings lead to a detailed investigation, involving data analysis, interviews, and site visits if necessary. The audit team compiles the report, which is reviewed and either approved or sent back for revisions by the audit director. Upon approval, the report is sent to the executive board, archived, and the audit process is closed.
