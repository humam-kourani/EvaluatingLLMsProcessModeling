The process starts when a customer signs up, entering personal and payment details. The system creates an account, grants access, and initiates billing cycles. During the subscription, the customer receives updates, product improvements, or renewal alerts. If canceling, the customer submits a request, which the support team handles, applying any necessary refunds or charges. The process ends with account deactivation and final balance settlement.
