The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel. When a guest calls room service, the room-service manager records the order and sends a ticket to the kitchen to start food preparation. She also instructs the sommelier to fetch wine from the cellar and prepare alcoholic beverages, as 80% of orders include alcohol. Then, she assigns the order to the waiter. While the kitchen and sommelier work, the waiter prepares a cart with a tablecloth and silverware and handles nonalcoholic drinks. Once everything is ready, the waiter delivers it to the guest’s room and later debits the guest’s account, sometimes waiting if another order needs attention.
