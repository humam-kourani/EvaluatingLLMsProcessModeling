When a department identifies a hiring need, HR drafts and posts a job description. Resumes are screened, and initial phone interviews are conducted. Chosen candidates attend in-person or virtual interviews. After selecting a candidate, an offer is made, with potential salary negotiations. Upon acceptance, onboarding starts, covering paperwork, orientation, and training. The process ends once onboarding is complete, and the new hire is integrated into the team.
