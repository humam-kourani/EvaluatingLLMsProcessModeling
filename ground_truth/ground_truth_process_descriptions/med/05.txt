The process starts when a company identifies the need for a new supplier. The procurement team issues an RFP and reviews supplier responses, evaluating each on cost, quality, and delivery time. Site visits or interviews may be conducted. After analysis, a supplier is chosen, and contract negotiations begin. Once terms are agreed upon, the contract is signed. The process concludes with the supplier's onboarding and contract execution.
