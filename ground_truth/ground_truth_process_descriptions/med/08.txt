An incident report, such as a technical issue or safety concern, is logged in a tracking system and assigned to a team. The team investigates, gathers information, identifies the cause, and suggests corrective actions. The solution—whether a fix, training, or policy update—is implemented. Follow-up ensures the issue won't recur, and the process concludes with the report's closure and stakeholder notification.
