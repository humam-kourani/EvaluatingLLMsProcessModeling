The process starts by identifying an employeeâ€™s development needs or career goals. The manager and HR then create a personal development plan, involving training, mentorship, or new responsibilities. The employee works on skill growth, receiving feedback from supervisors. Upon meeting milestones, they are considered for promotion. HR formally reviews performance, and if approved, finalizes the promotion with updated responsibilities and compensation. The process concludes as the employee transitions into the new role.
