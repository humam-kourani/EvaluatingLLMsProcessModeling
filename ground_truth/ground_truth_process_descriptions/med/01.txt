The process starts when a potential customer inquires about a product or service. Sales staff gather information and address any questions. If the customer shows interest, they are assisted in selecting the right product or service. The sales representative then provides a quote, and upon customer approval, the order is placed. The order is recorded in the system, and the customer receives confirmation, completing the process.
