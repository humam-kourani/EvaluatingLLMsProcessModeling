To purchase from an online shop, the user logs in, selects items, and sets a payment method simultaneously. They then pay or arrange an installment plan. After selecting items, they choose a free reward based on purchase value, independent of payment. Items are delivered. Users can return items for exchange; each return triggers a new delivery.
