The process begins with a department outlining objectives like hiring, equipment needs, or marketing. The team drafts a plan with cost estimates and justifications, which is reviewed in a strategic meeting to align with organizational goals. Next, the finance department assesses budget feasibility, leading to possible adjustments. Each change is documented and approved by stakeholders. After final approval, the budget is allocated, ending the process as the department begins implementing its plan.
