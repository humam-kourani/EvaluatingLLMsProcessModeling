The process starts when a customer files a complaint about a product or service. Customer service logs it and assigns it to the appropriate department for investigation. The team assesses validity and the need for a refund, then notifies the customer of the decision. If approved, the financial team processes the reimbursement. The complaint is marked as resolved once the customer receives the refund or is notified if rejected. Afterward, customers can provide feedback on their satisfaction.
