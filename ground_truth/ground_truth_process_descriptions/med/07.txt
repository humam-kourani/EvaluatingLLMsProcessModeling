The process starts with a customer searching for a travel ticket and selecting a route, date, and time. After providing personal and payment information, the booking system issues a ticket sent via email or SMS. The company updates its seat inventory. Before the trip, reminders and instructions may be sent for check-in or boarding. The process ends after the journey, with possible post-travel feedback or services.
