The process begins with identifying a new product idea or improvement. The R&D team conducts initial research and feasibility studies, then drafts design concepts. A selected design is prototyped with available resources and undergoes tests for functionality, safety, and market potential. Feedback from testing may prompt refinements, and testing is repeated if necessary. The process concludes when the prototype is either approved for further development or discarded.
