A university enrollment system includes these steps: Prospective students apply online, and the admissions office reviews the application. If documents are missing, the applicant is notified to provide them. Once complete, the admissions committee evaluates the application while the finance department processes fees. Accepted applicants receive an acceptance letter, otherwise, a rejection letter is sent. Accepted students confirm enrollment by a deadline to avoid cancellation. Upon confirmation, orientation materials are sent, and student accounts for email, portals, and library access are set up. International students receive visa assistance. Students then obtain an ID card, meet with an advisor, select courses, and resolve scheduling conflicts before starting classes. Each semester, students may adjust courses within the add/drop period, view grades online, and, if needed, file grievances. This cycle continues each semester until graduation or withdrawal.
