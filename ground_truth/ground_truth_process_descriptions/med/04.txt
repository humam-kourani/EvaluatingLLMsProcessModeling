The process begins with setting campaign objectives, targeting the audience, and defining goals like lead generation or brand awareness. The marketing team develops content, designs visuals, and chooses promotion channels, such as digital ads, emails, or social media. The campaign is launched, with real-time tracking of metrics like click-through rates and conversions. Generated leads are stored in the CRM for sales follow-up. The process ends with a performance analysis to guide future optimizations.
