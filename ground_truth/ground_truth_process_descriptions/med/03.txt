The process starts with monitoring inventory levels. When stock hits a set threshold, an alert signals the need to reorder. The procurement team orders from suppliers, factoring in cost, delivery time, and reliability. Once ordered, the inventory system logs the expected delivery. On receiving the stock, it's quality-checked, recorded, and stored. The process concludes with inventory levels updated post-restock.
