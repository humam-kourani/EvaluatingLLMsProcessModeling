This process begins when a customer searches for a flight, train, or bus ticket. After selecting the preferred route, date, and time, the customer provides personal information and payment details. The booking system generates a ticket, which is sent to the customer via email or SMS. The travel company updates its seat inventory accordingly. Before travel, the customer may receive reminders and instructions for check-in or boarding. The process concludes once the customer completes their journey, though post-travel feedback or services may extend it slightly.
