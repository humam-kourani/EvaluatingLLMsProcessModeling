The process starts with identifying an idea for a new product or improvement to an existing one. The R&D team conducts initial research and feasibility studies, followed by drafting design concepts. After selecting a promising design, a prototype is built using available materials and resources. The prototype undergoes various tests to assess its functionality, safety, and market potential. Feedback from the testing phase is collected, and the prototype may be refined accordingly. If a refinement is needed, then the testing phase is reinitiated. The process ends when the prototype is either approved for further development or discarded.
