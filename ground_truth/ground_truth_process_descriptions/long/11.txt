This process begins when a customer signs up for a subscription service, entering personal and payment information. The system generates an account, assigns access, and triggers automated billing cycles. Throughout the subscription, the customer receives regular updates, product enhancements, or renewal notifications. If the customer decides to cancel, they submit a cancellation request, which the support team processes. Depending on the terms, any refunds or charges are applied. The process concludes when the subscription is deactivated by the support team and the final account balance is settled.
