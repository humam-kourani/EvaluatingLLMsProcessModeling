The process starts when a company schedules a compliance audit for regulations such as ISO standards, safety protocols, or environmental guidelines. Internal teams prepare documentation, gather evidence, and conduct a self-assessment before the external audit. Auditors review the company's processes and identify any gaps or issues. After making the necessary corrections or improvements, the company undergoes a final audit. If all criteria are met, the company is awarded certification, and the process concludes with the issuance of official documents.
