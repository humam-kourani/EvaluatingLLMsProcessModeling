A university enrollment system involves the following steps:
Prospective students submit an application online.
The admissions office reviews the application and supporting documents.
If documents are missing, the applicant is notified to provide the missing items.
Upon receiving all documents, the application is evaluated by the admissions committee.
Concurrently, the finance department processes any application fees or waivers.
If the application is accepted, an acceptance letter is sent. Otherwise, a rejection letter is sent and the process ends.
After being accepted, the student must then confirm enrollment by a specified deadline; otherwise the application will be canceled.
If the student confirms, they receive orientation materials and the IT department sets up student accounts for email, online portals, and library access.
If the student is international, the international student office assists with visa processing.
The student obtains a student ID card and starts creating their study plan, which includes:
Meeting with an academic advisor.
Selecting courses.
Resolving any schedule conflicts.
The student begins attending classes.
Throughout each semester, the student may add or drop courses within the add/drop period.
At the end of the semester, grades are posted, and the student can review them online.
If the student has any grievances, they can file an appeal, which includes:
Submitting an appeal form.
Meeting with the appeals committee.
Awaiting a decision.
The process repeats each semester until the student graduates or withdraws.
