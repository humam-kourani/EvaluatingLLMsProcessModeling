This process begins when an employee or customer reports an incident, such as a technical issue or workplace safety concern. The report is logged into a tracking system and assigned to the appropriate team for investigation. The team gathers necessary information, identifies the cause of the incident, and proposes corrective actions. The solution is implemented, whether it’s a fix, training, or policy change. After the incident is resolved, a follow-up occurs to ensure that the issue won’t recur. The process ends when the incident report is closed, and all stakeholders are notified.
