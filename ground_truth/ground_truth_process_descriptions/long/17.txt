An e-commerce company has a comprehensive order fulfillment process:
When a customer places an order, the system records the order details.
Payment processing begins. If the payment fails, the customer is notified, and the process ends.
Upon successful payment, the inventory system checks stock availability.
If items are out of stock, a back-order is initiated, and the customer is informed about the delay. The process continues once the back-order is received and all required items are available in stock.
In-stock items are picked from the warehouse.
Quality control checks are performed on the picked items.
Packaging is done, including gift wrapping if the customer requested it.
Meanwhile, the shipping department prepares shipping documents and labels.
If the order is international, customs documentation is prepared.
Once packaging and shipping documents are ready, the order is dispatched.
The system sends a shipping confirmation to the customer.
After dispatch, the system updates the inventory levels.
A follow-up email for feedback is sent directly after confirming the successful delivery.
If the customer reports any issues upon delivery, a returns process is initiated, which includes:
Sending a return shipping label.
Receiving returned items.
Inspecting returned items.
Processing a refund or replacement.
