The process begins when a customer files a complaint about a product or service. Customer service logs the complaint and assigns it to the relevant department for investigation. After reviewing the details, the team determines whether the complaint is valid and whether a refund is justified and notifies the customer with the decision. If a refund is approved, the financial team processes the reimbursement. The complaint is marked as resolved once the customer receives the refund or directly after notifying the customer in case the refund was rejected. After resolving the case, customers can provide feedback on their satisfaction.
