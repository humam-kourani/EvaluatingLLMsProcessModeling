Here's an evaluation of the provided POWL models:

**IT1:**

* **Behavior Accuracy:** This model accurately represents the main flow, including the skill enhancement loop and the promotion process. The concurrency between setting new responsibilities and adjusting compensation is also correctly modeled.
* **Completeness:** Includes all the required activities.
* **Correctness:** The structure is correct with appropriate use of loops and partial orders.

**IT2:**

* **Behavior Accuracy:**  While mostly correct, this model introduces an unnecessary copy of "Consider employee for promotion or new role."  This doesn't necessarily harm the model's logic, but it adds complexity without a clear purpose. The intent seems to be to model a potential loop back to the consideration stage, but the description doesn't suggest this.
* **Completeness:** Includes all the required activities.
* **Correctness:** Control flow is correctly implemented, although the use of the copied activity isn't ideal.

**IT3:**

* **Behavior Accuracy:** This model fails to capture the concurrency between "Set new responsibilities" and "Adjust compensation".  It enforces an artificial sequential order between them, which isn't present in the description.  The feedback loop is modeled well.
* **Completeness:** Includes all the required activities.
* **Correctness:** Structurally correct apart from the enforced sequence mentioned above.

**IT4:**

* **Behavior Accuracy:** This model accurately captures the process flow, including the iterative nature of skill enhancement, the steps involved in the promotion process, and the final transition to the new role.  The concurrency within the promotion process is correctly handled.
* **Completeness:**  Includes all the required activities.
* **Correctness:** The model utilizes partial orders and loops correctly, making it a good representation of the described process.
