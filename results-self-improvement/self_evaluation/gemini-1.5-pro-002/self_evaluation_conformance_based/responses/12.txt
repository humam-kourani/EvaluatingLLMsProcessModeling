**Explanation of Scores:**

* **IT1:** This model closely represents the process. It correctly models the skill enhancement loop and the promotion process.  The concurrency between setting new responsibilities and adjusting compensation is well-captured. The only minor issue is that 'Consider employee for promotion or new role' should not be part of the promotion process. The milestone can be reached before the promotion process, so consider employee for promotion or new role can happen any time after Create personal development plan

* **IT2:** The use of a copy of 'consider_promotion' is unnecessary and makes the model slightly less precise. 'Consider employee for promotion or new role' should not be part of the promotion process. The milestone can be reached before the promotion process, so consider employee for promotion or new role can happen any time after Create personal development plan. Consider employee for promotion or new role should happen directly after the feedback loop. This is an iterative process where the employee works on skills, receives feedback, and then is considered for promotion. The promotion process itself should start with a formal review.

* **IT3:** This model enforces a sequential order between setting responsibilities and adjusting compensation, which is not specified in the process description. These actions can occur concurrently or in any order.  Furthermore, there are some errors. The skill enhancement loop and the subsequent actions up to considering promotion should occur before the formal review for promotion, so the model's sequence is incorrect. The process is supposed to end when the employee transitions into the new role, but this model links it sequentially after adjusting the compensation, which is not correct.

* **IT4:**  This is the best model among the given options. It accurately reflects the process description by including the skill enhancement loop and the promotion process. The concurrency between setting new responsibilities and adjusting compensation is correctly represented within the partial order for 'promotion_process'. It also accurately depicts the sequence of the overall process.
