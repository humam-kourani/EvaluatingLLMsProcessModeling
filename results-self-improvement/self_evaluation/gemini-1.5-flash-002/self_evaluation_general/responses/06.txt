Based on the provided process description and the generated POWL models, here's an evaluation of their quality:

* **IT1:** This model is quite good. It correctly models the initial order placement as an exclusive choice, the sequential steps of order processing, and the optional customer feedback/returns process using partial orders.  The use of `copy()` to avoid reusing activities is appropriate, ensuring the model accurately reflects the process flow. However, the structure of combining everything with nested partial orders could be simplified (though it is technically correct).  The initial steps, core fulfillment and final steps are presented as partial orders that are then linked as a sequence (i.e., partially ordered again). This is a bit cumbersome for readability.

* **IT2:** This model is simpler and more direct than IT1. It models the main process flow effectively as a single partial order representing a sequence of activities.  The addition of optional feedback/returns as an XOR is also correct. It's less verbose than IT1 and is easier to understand, but the handling of the order placement (XOR) is very similar to IT1. The approach is less complex and better.

* **IT3:** This model is similar to IT1 but with some redundancies and unnecessary copies. Like IT1, it uses nested partial orders which increases complexity.  The use of `copy()` is technically correct but adds unnecessary complexity to the model. The overall logic is correct. The unnecessary copies and the nested partial orders decrease the quality of the model.


* **IT4:** This model is very similar to IT2, but it models the optional feedback/returns process as an XOR of the entire process, not just the feedback step itself. This is a very minor inaccuracy, making this one of the best options. The choice between handling the feedback/returns step as part of the main process flow vs. separate might be a design choice, but the latter (as done in this model) is generally more desirable.

Considering these observations:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.85,
    'IT2': 0.90,
    'IT3': 0.75,
    'IT4': 0.95
}
```
