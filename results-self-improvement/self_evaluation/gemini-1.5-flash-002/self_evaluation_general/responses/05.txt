Based on the provided process description and the four generated POWL models (IT1, IT2, IT3, IT4), here's an evaluation of their quality:

**Evaluation:**

* **IT1:** This model is quite good. It correctly sequences the main steps of the process. The use of a partial order for evaluation steps and the optional nature of site visits/interviews are well-represented.  The use of multiple copies of `select_supplier` is a bit clumsy but addresses the issue of reusing a node within a partial order, which is a correct approach.  However, it doesn't explicitly handle the possibility of multiple supplier proposals requiring multiple iterations of evaluation.  Therefore, it slightly lacks completeness.

* **IT2:** This model improves upon IT1 by introducing a loop to handle multiple proposals.  The use of a loop for evaluating multiple proposals is a significant improvement in handling the iterative nature of this part of the process. The optional site visit and interview are also correctly implemented. However, it uses a single point for selecting a supplier rather than integrating the selection into the loop. Therefore it lacks complete accuracy in its representation of the supplier selection process.

* **IT3:** This model is less accurate. It combines the proposal evaluation and post-selection steps into one partial order, making it unclear how the selection of the supplier occurs within the evaluation steps. The model fails to show the optional aspect of the site visit and interview steps, nor does it represent the possibility of evaluating multiple proposals.

* **IT4:**  This model is similar to IT1 in its handling of the main sequence but uses unnecessary copies of activities within the `post_evaluation_poset`. The main weakness is the incorrect modeling of the selection process. It implies the selection occurs after each proposal evaluation.


**Scores:**

Considering the above analysis, here's a scoring reflecting the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of each model:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.85,
    'IT2': 0.90,
    'IT3': 0.70,
    'IT4': 0.80
}
```
