Based on the provided process description and the generated POWL models, here's an evaluation of their quality:

* **IT1:** This model attempts to capture the process but has some structural issues.  The use of multiple `partial_order` calls for seemingly sequential steps isn't ideal and makes the model harder to understand.  The model's logic around the decision-making and resolution processes might not be precisely aligned with the description. While it includes all activities, the flow between `decision_making` and the resolution process (`resolution_process`) could be clearer and more directly reflect the exclusive choice. The structure is overly complex for this relatively simple process.  The copying of activities, although seemingly correct to avoid reuse, adds unnecessary complexity.

* **IT2:** This model is significantly improved over IT1. By using more copies of activities, it avoids problematic reuse within a single partial order.  It explicitly separates the refund and no-refund paths, making the exclusive choice clearer. However, the handling of the final feedback step ("Provide feedback") could be simplified.  There's some redundancy with the creation of multiple partial orders for steps that could be combined.

* **IT3:** This model shows a good understanding of the process, especially in how it splits the "Resolve Complaint" and "Provide Feedback" activities based on the refund decision.  It correctly models the exclusive choice between the refund and no-refund paths. However, it still uses multiple partial orders where a single one would suffice.

* **IT4:**  This model is the most straightforward and accurate of the four. It efficiently uses partial orders to represent sequential steps and an XOR to represent the decision point.  It also uses activity copies to avoid reuse, simplifying the model compared to IT1 and IT2.  The final partial order elegantly incorporates all subprocesses.


Considering the above analysis, I assign the following scores:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.65,
    'IT2': 0.80,
    'IT3': 0.75,
    'IT4': 0.90
}
```
