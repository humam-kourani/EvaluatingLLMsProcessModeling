**Evaluation Rationale:**

The evaluation considers fitness (how well the model captures the process) and precision (how well it avoids representing disallowed behaviors).  Here's a breakdown of each model:

* **IT1:** This model is excellent. It correctly captures the iterative review process using a `loop` and represents the sequential dependencies accurately using `partial_order`. The use of copies avoids illegal reuse of submodels. The score reflects a minor imperfection in precisely capturing the number of review cycles and feedback steps but the overall representation of the process is very accurate.

* **IT2:**  This model attempts to model the iterative review process using a loop with an optional redo part. The use of copies to prevent reuse is positive. However, the structure with nested `partial_order`s is somewhat less clear and slightly less accurate than IT1 in representing the iterative nature of review and feedback steps, resulting in a lower score.

* **IT3:** This model has a significant weakness. It uses a `loop` for the review process, but the loop is a self-loop, potentially allowing for infinite iteration.  The iterative nature is captured, but the precision is reduced. The handling of the feedback step isn't precise, it's only partially accurate and therefore has a lower score.

* **IT4:**  This model improves on IT3 by using copies effectively but still has a slightly less accurate representation of the iterative review process compared to IT1. The structure is fairly clear and avoids reuse, but it's not as concise and efficient as IT1. The overall capturing of the behavior is better than IT3, thus it has a higher score.


The scores reflect a subjective judgment balancing fitness and precision. A perfect score (1.0) would require a model that flawlessly matches the description in both aspects, which is difficult to achieve in complex processes.
