Based on the provided process description and the four generated POWL models (IT1, IT2, IT3, IT4), here's an evaluation of their quality:

**IT1:** This model demonstrates a good attempt at capturing the process flow.  It correctly models the concurrency between application fee processing and application evaluation. The use of partial orders for sequential and concurrent steps is mostly appropriate. However, the excessive copying of activities (e.g., `send_acceptance_copy`, `confirm_enrollment_copy`) suggests potential over-engineering and could make the model less readable and maintainable.  There is also some ambiguity in how the semester loop interacts with graduation or withdrawal. The model also lacks clarity in handling optional processes.

**IT2:** This model shows significant improvement in handling concurrency and sequential dependencies. It's cleaner than IT1, using loops effectively for iterative processes (missing documents, semester loop). The organization of sub-processes is logical. However, the handling of the optional international student support could be more explicit.  The model seems to handle the termination conditions (graduation and withdrawal) more clearly than IT1. However, it also overuses the `.copy()` method.


**IT3:** This model is less successful in capturing the intricate process behavior. The use of partial orders often lacks sufficient dependencies, leading to an inaccurate representation of the intended flow. Many concurrent steps are not correctly represented by parallel branches in the partial orders, leading to incorrect sequencing or missing dependencies. The semester loop is poorly integrated.

**IT4:** This model is similar to IT2 but with some improvements. It uses loops efficiently.  However, it might miss some subtle dependencies within the semester loop and the handling of the appeal process could be more clear.  Additionally, it also excessively uses the copy method.


**Score Dictionary:**

Considering the above analysis, here's a score dictionary reflecting the quality of the POWL models:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.75,
    'IT2': 0.85,
    'IT3': 0.60,
    'IT4': 0.80
}
```
