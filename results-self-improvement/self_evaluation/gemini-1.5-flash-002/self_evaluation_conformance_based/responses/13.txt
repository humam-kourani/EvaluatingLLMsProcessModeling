The provided process description outlines a complaint handling process with two main branches after complaint review: refund approval and rejection.  Let's evaluate each POWL model:

* **IT1:** This model uses partial orders to represent sequential steps and an XOR to handle the decision point.  However, it reuses activities (e.g., `assign_complaint`), which is not allowed. The structure is largely correct in terms of capturing the flow but lacks precision due to activity reuse.  The feedback step is correctly added at the end.

* **IT2:** This model attempts to address the reuse issue by creating copies of activities.  The separation of refund and no-refund paths is well-structured. This significantly improves precision. However,  it creates unnecessary complexity with excessive copies and sub-posets. The final combination of feedback paths is also awkwardly structured.

* **IT3:** This model is also well-structured, and it avoids activity reuse by creating separate activities for the "Resolve complaint" and "Provide feedback" actions for each path. The structure is clear and directly reflects the process description.

* **IT4:** This model also correctly separates refund and non-refund branches. It also uses copies of activities to avoid reuse, leading to a more precise model. The combination of elements is clear and directly reflects the process description, but it misses incorporating customer feedback for the case where a refund is not provided.


Based on this analysis:

* **IT3** is the best because it's the clearest and most accurately reflects the process description while adhering to the POWL rules.

* **IT4** is good but lacks the feedback path for rejected complaints.

* **IT1** has the right general structure but fails to meet the precision requirement due to activity reuse.

* **IT2** is overly complex and while it solves the reuse issue, it introduces other complexities that negatively impact readability and maintainability.


Therefore, the scores would be:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.7,
    'IT2': 0.8,
    'IT3': 0.95,
    'IT4': 0.85
}
```
