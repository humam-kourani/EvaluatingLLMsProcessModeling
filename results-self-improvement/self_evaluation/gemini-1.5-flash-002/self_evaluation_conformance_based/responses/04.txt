The provided process description outlines a sequential process with some concurrency. Let's evaluate each model:

* **IT1:** This model uses a series of partial orders to represent the process.  The concurrent activities of content creation, design, and channel selection are accurately modeled. The post-launch activities are also correctly sequenced. However, it unnecessarily separates the launch campaign into two separate activities. The overall flow is good, but the unnecessary copy of `launch_campaign` suggests a minor flaw in design.

* **IT2:** This model is similar to IT1 but attempts to combine the post-launch activities into a single partial order, improving on IT1. It also cleverly uses a copy of `launch_campaign` to handle the branching.  The structure is logical and reflects the sequential and concurrent aspects.

* **IT3:** This model incorrectly models the post-launch activities as largely concurrent, which isn't reflected in the description (tracking must precede lead collection). It misses the crucial sequential nature of the activities post-launch and incorrectly allows concurrent execution of tracking and lead collection.


* **IT4:** This model correctly captures the sequence of events, handles concurrency appropriately, and uses partial orders effectively to manage dependencies. It doesn't suffer from the flaws observed in IT3.


Based on this analysis:

```python
score_dictionary = {
    'IT1': 0.85,
    'IT2': 0.90,
    'IT3': 0.70,
    'IT4': 0.95
}
```
