**Detailed Evaluation:**

Each model has strengths and weaknesses in capturing the complexity of the e-commerce order fulfillment process.  The scoring reflects this nuanced assessment.

* **IT1:** This model demonstrates a reasonable attempt at capturing the main flow. However, it misses the crucial concurrency between packaging and shipping document preparation.  The handling of international orders is also less precise than in other models. The backorder process is also somewhat simplified. The score reflects these inaccuracies.

* **IT2:** This model shows an improvement over IT1 in terms of concurrency (although still not perfectly representing all concurrent actions). The use of `xor` for optional activities (gift wrapping, international documentation) is well-executed.  However, it still simplifies certain aspects, particularly the detailed interactions within the backorder and return processes. The score increases, due to its better handling of optional activities.

* **IT3:** This model attempts to address concurrency issues, but in doing so creates unnecessary copies of activities and overcomplicates the model.  This leads to lower precision as it introduces potential for unintended behavior. The model suffers from an overly complex representation, reducing the overall score.

* **IT4:** This model shows a good understanding of the process flow and employs loops and xors effectively in some sections (payment handling, backorder handling). However, the handling of concurrency and some optional steps is not as elegant or precise as in IT2, resulting in a score lower than the most accurate model. The model is unnecessarily complex for certain subprocesses and might be hard to follow compared to model IT2.


**Overall:**  IT2 provides the best balance between fitness and precision, reasonably representing the process while maintaining a relatively clear structure.  The other models have various flaws, such as oversimplification, over-complexity, and incorrect handling of concurrency or optional steps.
