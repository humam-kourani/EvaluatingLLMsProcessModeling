The marketing campaign process begins with a planning phase, which involves defining campaign objectives, target audience, budget, and key performance indicators (KPIs).  Following the planning phase, suitable channels for reaching the target audience are selected. Content tailored to the chosen channels and target audience is then developed.  The campaign is launched across the selected channels, and real-time tracking of performance metrics, such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and engagement, is initiated.  Upon reaching the pre-defined campaign end date, or upon meeting specific performance criteria, the campaign is concluded. A post-campaign analysis is then conducted, evaluating the collected performance data against the defined KPIs.  The insights gathered during this analysis are documented and used to inform and improve future marketing campaigns.
