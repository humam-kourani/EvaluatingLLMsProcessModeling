The process begins with the initiation of an internal preparation phase.  This phase involves gathering and collating all necessary documentation and evidence related to the regulatory standards.  Once all documentation is compiled, a comprehensive internal review is conducted to identify any gaps or areas of non-compliance.  If gaps are identified, corrective actions are implemented and documented. This cycle of internal review and corrective action repeats until all identified gaps are addressed.  Following the successful completion of the internal preparation phase, the process proceeds to an external review phase.  An external auditor is engaged to assess the company's compliance based on the prepared documentation and evidence. The external auditor provides a report detailing their findings. If the external auditor identifies any non-compliance issues, the company must address these issues and provide evidence of the remediation to the auditor.  This iterative process of review and remediation continues until the external auditor is satisfied. Upon successful completion of the external review,  the company receives a final certification confirming their adherence to the regulatory standards. If the company fails to meet the regulatory standards, they do not receive certification, and the process ends.  The certification is valid for a specific period and requires renewal through a subsequent audit process.
