The process begins when a customer initiates a subscription request for a service. Upon successful validation of the request, the subscription is activated, and the customer is notified of the successful subscription. Subsequently, the customer periodically receives service updates and enters into recurring billing cycles based on their chosen subscription plan.  During the subscription period, the customer may request to cancel their subscription at any time. Upon receiving a cancellation request, the support team initiates the deactivation process, which includes terminating service access and generating a final bill. After the final bill is issued and any outstanding payments are settled, the subscription is officially terminated, and the customer is notified of the completion of the cancellation process.  If a customer does not request cancellation, the subscription and billing cycle continue.
