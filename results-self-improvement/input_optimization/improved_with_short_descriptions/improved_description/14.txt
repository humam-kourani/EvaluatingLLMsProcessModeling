The process begins with the department drafting a budget plan. This draft must be aligned with the documented organizational goals. The drafted budget plan then enters a review and adjustment phase. This phase consists of multiple iterations of review and subsequent adjustments to the budget plan.  Each review may result in adjustments to the plan, and the cycle repeats until a final decision is reached. Following the review and adjustment phase, the budget plan is submitted for final approval. There is an exclusive choice between approval and rejection of the budget plan. If the budget plan is approved, allocated funds are released to the department. These allocated funds are specifically designated for implementing the objectives detailed within the approved budget plan. If the budget plan is rejected, the process may return to the drafting stage, or an alternative course of action is taken, depending on the reason for rejection.  Following fund allocation (upon approval), the department proceeds to implement its objectives as outlined in the approved and funded budget plan.
