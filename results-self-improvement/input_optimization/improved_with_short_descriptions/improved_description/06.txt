The process begins with a customer placing an order. This order is then reviewed and confirmed, potentially involving checks for inventory availability and payment authorization.  Following order confirmation, the picking process commences, where the ordered items are retrieved from the warehouse or storage location. Specific picking methods may vary. Once picked, the items are packed for shipment, which includes appropriate packaging materials and labeling.  After packing, the order is shipped using a selected shipping carrier.  Shipment tracking information is then generated and provided to the customer.  Upon delivery, the process continues with a follow-up to solicit customer feedback.  There is an exclusive choice between the customer initiating a return or concluding the process. If a return is initiated, a return merchandise authorization (RMA) is generated, and the returned product is received and processed.  If no return is initiated, the process concludes successfully.
