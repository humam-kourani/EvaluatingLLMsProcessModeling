The process begins with conducting initial research. Based on the findings of this research, a product prototype is generated.  This prototype then undergoes a testing phase. Following the testing phase, the prototype is evaluated. If the evaluation reveals deficiencies, the prototype is refined and then retested. This refine-and-retest cycle continues iteratively until the prototype meets acceptance criteria. After successful testing, the prototype is submitted for final approval.  There is an exclusive choice between granting final approval and dismissing the prototype. If the prototype is dismissed, the process ends. If the prototype receives final approval, the process ends.
