The process begins when a customer submits an inquiry.  Following the inquiry, the customer engages in product selection.  Once the product selection is complete, a quote is generated and presented to the customer.  If the customer accepts the quote, they proceed to place an order. Upon successful order placement, the customer receives an order confirmation, which marks the end of the process. If the customer rejects the quote, the process ends.
