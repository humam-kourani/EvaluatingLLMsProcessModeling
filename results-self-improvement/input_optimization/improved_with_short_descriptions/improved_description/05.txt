The process begins with the identification of a need for a new supplier.  The company then defines specific requirements and criteria for the new supplier.  An RFP (Request for Proposal) is drafted, outlining these requirements and criteria, and subsequently distributed to potential suppliers.  Following distribution, the company receives proposals from various suppliers.  These proposals are then evaluated against the pre-defined criteria. This evaluation process may involve multiple stages and stakeholders.  Based on the evaluation results, a preferred supplier is selected.  Contract negotiations are initiated with the selected supplier.  If the negotiations are successful and an agreement is reached, a contract is finalized.  If negotiations fail, the company may choose to re-engage with other suitable suppliers from the initial RFP process or initiate a new RFP process. Once the contract is finalized, the onboarding process for the new supplier commences. This onboarding process may include activities such as system integration, training, and establishing communication channels.  After successful onboarding, the new supplier is integrated into the company's operations.
