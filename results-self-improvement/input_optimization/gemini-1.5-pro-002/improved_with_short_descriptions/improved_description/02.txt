The hiring process begins with the creation of a job posting, which includes defining the job requirements, responsibilities, and qualifications.  After the job posting is published, applications are received and the candidate screening process begins. This involves reviewing resumes and cover letters to assess candidates' qualifications against the defined job requirements.  Candidates who meet the initial criteria are then contacted for interviews. The interview process may consist of multiple rounds, including initial screening interviews, technical interviews, and final interviews with hiring managers or teams.  Following the interviews, a decision is made regarding which candidate to extend an offer to.  If an offer is accepted, the onboarding process begins. This involves completing necessary paperwork, providing access to company resources, and integrating the new employee into the team and company culture. Onboarding continues until the new hire is considered fully integrated into the organization.  If an offer is declined, the hiring process may return to the candidate screening stage to consider other applicants.
