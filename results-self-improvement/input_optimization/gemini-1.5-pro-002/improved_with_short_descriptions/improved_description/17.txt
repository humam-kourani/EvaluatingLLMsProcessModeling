The order fulfillment process of an e-commerce company begins with the recording of a new customer order.  Following order recording, the process proceeds to payment processing.  After successful payment processing, the available inventory is checked against the ordered items. If sufficient inventory exists for all ordered items, the process proceeds to picking and inspecting those items.  If insufficient inventory exists for one or more items, the process diverges into two parallel paths: one for handling the in-stock items and one for managing the back-ordered items.  For back-ordered items, the process includes notifying the customer about the back-order status and estimated fulfillment timeline.  Once the available items have been picked, they undergo an inspection process to ensure quality and accuracy.  Following inspection, both the in-stock and eventually fulfilled back-ordered items proceed to the packaging stage.  Concurrently with packaging, the shipping documents are prepared. After packaging and shipping document preparation are complete, the order is dispatched for delivery to the customer.  Post-dispatch, the inventory levels are updated to reflect the shipped items. Finally, the process includes a provision for managing customer returns and processing refunds, which is triggered if any issues arise after the delivery of the order.  This post-delivery process includes receiving the returned items, inspecting them to determine the reason for return, and then either processing a refund or initiating an exchange as appropriate.
