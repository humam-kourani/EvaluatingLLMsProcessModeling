A personal development plan is created for the employee.  This plan outlines specific skills to be enhanced and defines measurable milestones. The employee then engages in activities to enhance the identified skills.  Progress against the milestones in the personal development plan is monitored. Once all milestones are met, the employee's performance and newly acquired skills are formally reviewed to assess their eligibility for a promotion.  If the review determines the employee is eligible for promotion, a formal approval process is initiated.  Upon receiving formal approval, the employee's compensation is adjusted to reflect the promotion.  If the review determines the employee is not eligible for promotion at this time, the personal development plan is reviewed and potentially revised, and the employee continues skill development efforts.
