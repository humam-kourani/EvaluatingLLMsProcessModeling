The process begins when a customer submits a complaint.  Following the submission, the complaint undergoes an investigation process.  This investigation then leads to a decision regarding the validity of the complaint. Based on the validity decision, a determination is made regarding the customer's eligibility for a refund.  The customer is then notified of the decision and the refund eligibility outcome.  Subsequently, the complaint resolution is processed. After the resolution, there is an exclusive choice between the customer providing feedback and the process ending without feedback.
