When an incident is reported, it is logged, including relevant details such as the time of the incident, the nature of the incident, and the reporting party.  Following logging, the incident is assigned to a designated investigator based on predefined criteria. The investigator then investigates the incident to determine the root cause. Based on the investigation's findings, corrective actions are determined and implemented to resolve the incident. After the corrective actions are implemented, a follow-up is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions and to identify any preventive measures to avoid recurrence of similar incidents.  Once the follow-up is complete and the incident is deemed resolved, the incident is closed.  Closure includes notification to relevant stakeholders, summarizing the incident, the corrective actions taken, and the preventive measures implemented.
