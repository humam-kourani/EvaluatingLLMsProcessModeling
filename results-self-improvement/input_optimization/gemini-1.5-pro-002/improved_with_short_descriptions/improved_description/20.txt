The room-service process at The Evanstonian begins when a guest places an order.  The manager receives the guest's order, records the order details (including items, quantities, and any special requests), and assigns specific parts of the order to the kitchen, the sommelier (if applicable), and a designated waiter.  The kitchen staff prepares the food items according to the order.  Concurrently, the sommelier, if wine or other beverages requiring sommelier service are part of the order, selects and prepares the requested beverages.  The designated waiter collects the prepared food items from the kitchen and any beverages from the sommelier.  The waiter then assembles a room-service cart with the complete order, including necessary cutlery, condiments, and tableware.  Following cart assembly, the waiter delivers the cart to the guest's room.  Once the delivery is complete and the guest has acknowledged receipt, the waiter retrieves the used cart and returns it to the designated area. Finally, the waiter debits the guest's account according to the confirmed order details.
