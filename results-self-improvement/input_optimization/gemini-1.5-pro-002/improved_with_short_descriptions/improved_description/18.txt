The enrollment process begins when a prospective student submits an online application.  Following application submission, the university evaluates the application and makes an admission decision. If the student is admitted, they proceed to fee processing. Upon successful payment, the enrollment system confirms the student's enrollment.  The enrolled student then participates in orientation activities.  Concurrently with or following orientation, the student's university account is set up, granting access to required systems.  After account setup, the student selects courses for the upcoming semester and formally registers for those selected courses.  Throughout the semester, grades are recorded within the system.  There is a process for appealing grades if a student disagrees with the assigned grade.  This cycle of course selection, registration, grading, and potential appeals repeats each term until the student graduates or withdraws from the university.  In the case of withdrawal, the student's enrollment in the system is terminated.  In the case of graduation, the student's record is updated to reflect their graduated status and access to certain systems may be modified.
