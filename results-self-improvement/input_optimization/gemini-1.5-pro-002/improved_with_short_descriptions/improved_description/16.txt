The annual audit process begins with the initiation of document preparation activities, including gathering financial records, operational reports, and compliance documentation.  Concurrently, a risk assessment is conducted to identify and prioritize potential areas of concern.  Based on the risk assessment, specific compliance checks are performed, targeting the identified high-risk areas. If discrepancies or potential violations are detected during the compliance checks, an exclusive choice is made between initiating a detailed investigation or, if the discrepancy is minor and easily rectified, documenting the issue and the corrective action taken.  All findings from the compliance checks, along with the results of any investigations conducted, are consolidated into a comprehensive audit report. This report undergoes a review and approval process by the audit director. Following the audit director's approval, the final audit report is distributed to the executive board for their review and consideration.
