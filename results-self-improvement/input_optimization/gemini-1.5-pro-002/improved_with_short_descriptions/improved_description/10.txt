The process begins with the reception of a request for an IT solution.  IT then assesses the request, which includes analyzing the requirements, evaluating feasibility, and determining potential risks and costs.  Following the assessment, if the request is approved, IT proceeds with the procurement phase. This involves identifying and selecting vendors, negotiating contracts, and ordering the necessary hardware and/or software.  Next, the procured solution undergoes a thorough testing phase. This includes functional testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure it meets the specified requirements and quality standards.  If the solution passes all tests, IT initiates the rollout phase. This involves deploying the solution to the end-users, configuring the system, and migrating data as needed.  During and after the rollout, IT provides support to address any user issues or technical difficulties.  Furthermore, if required based on the complexity of the solution, IT develops and delivers training to end-users on how to effectively utilize the new IT solution.  If the initial assessment determines the request is not feasible or approved, the process ends and the requestor is notified.
