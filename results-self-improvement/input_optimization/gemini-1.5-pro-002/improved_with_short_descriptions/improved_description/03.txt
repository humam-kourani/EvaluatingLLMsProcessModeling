Inventory levels are continuously monitored.  When inventory levels fall below a predefined reorder point, a reorder request is generated. This request triggers the procurement process, where an order is placed with a supplier. Upon arrival of the ordered inventory, the inventory records in the system are updated to reflect the delivery.  The received inventory then undergoes an inspection process. Following successful inspection, the inventory is stored in the designated storage location. Finally, the stored inventory is used to restock the active inventory, and the system's inventory levels are updated accordingly.
