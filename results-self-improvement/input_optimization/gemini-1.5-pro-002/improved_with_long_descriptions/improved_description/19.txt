The process begins when a user initiates an order by logging in to their account.  Following login, the user selects the items they wish to purchase and concurrently sets their desired payment method.  Subsequently, there is an exclusive choice: the user either proceeds with a direct payment or establishes an installment agreement. Independently of the chosen payment process, after item selection, the user is presented with a choice of multiple free reward options. The value of the available reward options is determined by the total value of the selected purchase items.  After the reward selection (and the payment or installment agreement), the purchased items are delivered to the user. Following delivery, the user has the option to return items for exchange.  For each instance of item return, a new delivery of the exchanged items is initiated.
