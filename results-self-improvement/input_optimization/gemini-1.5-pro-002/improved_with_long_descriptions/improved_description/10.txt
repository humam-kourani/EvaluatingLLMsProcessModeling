The process begins with the submission of a request for an IT solution (e.g., new software, new hardware, or modifications to existing systems) by an employee or a department.  Upon reception of the request, the IT department initiates an assessment phase. This assessment includes verifying the request's compatibility with existing IT infrastructure and systems,  evaluating the associated costs, and determining the necessary resources (e.g., personnel, time).  Following the assessment, a decision is made regarding the approval or rejection of the request. If the request is approved, the IT department proceeds with the procurement of the necessary tools, software licenses, or hardware. Subsequently, the IT department installs the procured solution and conducts testing within a controlled environment to ensure its functionality and stability.  If the testing is successful, the new IT solution is deployed and rolled out to the requesting employee or department.  Following the rollout, there is a decision point regarding the provision of training.  If training is deemed necessary, it is provided to the users of the new IT solution.  Finally, ongoing IT support is provided to address any troubleshooting needs or issues that may arise.
