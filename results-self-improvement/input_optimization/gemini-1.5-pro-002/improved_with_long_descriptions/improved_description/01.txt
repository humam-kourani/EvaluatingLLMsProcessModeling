This process begins when a potential customer submits an inquiry regarding a product or service.  Upon inquiry submission, the sales staff or customer support representative gathers relevant information from the potential customer, such as their needs and requirements, and addresses any initial concerns or questions the customer may have. Following this information gathering stage, a decision point is reached where the customer either expresses interest in proceeding or declines further engagement. If the customer expresses interest, they are guided by the sales staff or customer support representative through the selection of the appropriate product or service based on their previously stated needs and requirements.  Subsequently, the sales representative generates and presents a quote to the customer for the selected product or service.  Another decision point is reached where the customer either approves the quote or rejects it. Upon quote approval, the process proceeds to order placement, wherein the sales representative initiates the order creation process.  Once the order is initiated, it is recorded within the order management system.  After successful system recording, order confirmation is sent to the customer, including order details and expected delivery or fulfillment timeframe.  The process concludes when the order is successfully placed within the system and confirmed with the customer.
