This process begins with continuous monitoring of inventory levels for each product in a warehouse or store.  When the stock level of a product reaches a predefined minimum threshold, a system generates an automated alert.  In parallel, a manual check of inventory levels is performed periodically. If the manual check reveals a product's stock level below the threshold, it also triggers a reorder signal.  These two reorder triggers (automated alert or manual check) initiate the next step. The procurement team receives the reorder signal and begins the supplier selection process, evaluating potential suppliers based on predefined criteria including cost, delivery time, and supplier reliability. The procurement team then places a purchase order with the chosen supplier, specifying quantities for each product required. Once the purchase order is confirmed by the supplier, the inventory management system is updated with the expected delivery date for each product ordered. Upon receiving the shipment from the supplier, each delivered item is inspected for quality.  If an item passes inspection, it is recorded in the inventory management system, updating the available quantity for that product. The received item is then placed on shelves in the sales area or stored in the designated storage location within the warehouse. The process concludes when the inventory levels of all received and inspected items are updated in the system, reflecting the completed restocking activity.
