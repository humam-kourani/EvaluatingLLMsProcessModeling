A university enrollment system begins when a prospective student submits an application online.  The admissions office then reviews the submitted application and supporting documents.  If any documents are missing, the admissions office notifies the applicant to provide the missing items. This notification process repeats until all required documents are received. Once all documents are received, the admissions committee evaluates the application. Concurrently, the finance department processes any associated application fees or waivers. There is an exclusive choice based on the evaluation result: if the application is accepted, the admissions office sends an acceptance letter to the applicant. Otherwise, the admissions office sends a rejection letter, and the process ends.  Following acceptance, the student must confirm their enrollment by a specified deadline. If the student fails to confirm enrollment by the deadline, the application is canceled, and the process ends. If the student confirms enrollment, the university sends orientation materials to the student, and the IT department sets up student accounts for various services, including email, online portals, and library access. Additionally, if the student is an international student, the international student office assists with visa processing.  The student then obtains a student ID card and begins the process of creating their study plan. This process involves meeting with an academic advisor, selecting courses, and resolving any potential schedule conflicts. After completing their study plan, the student begins attending classes. Throughout each semester, there is an optional process where the student may add or drop courses within the add/drop period. At the end of each semester, the university posts grades, which the student can review online.  If the student has any grievances regarding their grades, they can initiate an appeals process. This process includes submitting an appeal form, meeting with the appeals committee, and awaiting a decision from the committee. This entire semester process, starting from course selection and ending with grade posting and the optional appeal, repeats for each semester until the student graduates or withdraws from the university.
