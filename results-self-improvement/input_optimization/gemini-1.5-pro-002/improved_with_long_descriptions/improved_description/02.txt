This process begins when a department triggers the process by submitting a new hire request, specifying the need and requirements for the new position.  Upon receiving the new hire request, HR initiates the recruitment process.  HR creates a detailed job description outlining responsibilities, qualifications, and compensation range. The job description is then posted on relevant job boards and potentially distributed through other recruitment channels.  Applications, including resumes and cover letters, are collected until a predefined application deadline or until a sufficient number of qualified applicants have been received.  The received applications are screened against the defined criteria in the job description.  Candidates who meet the initial criteria are contacted for an initial phone screening interview. Based on the outcome of the phone screening, a subset of candidates is selected and invited for a secondary interview.  There is an exclusive choice between conducting the secondary interview in-person or virtually, based on the candidate's location and preference.  Following the secondary interviews, the most suitable candidate is selected. A formal job offer, outlining the terms of employment including compensation and benefits, is extended to the selected candidate.  Following the job offer, there is an exclusive choice between entering salary negotiations or accepting the initial offer. If negotiations occur, the offer may be revised. If the candidate accepts the job offer (either initial or negotiated), the onboarding process is triggered.  The onboarding process involves the completion of necessary paperwork, attending an orientation program, and undertaking relevant job-specific training.  The process concludes when all onboarding steps are completed and the new hire is marked as active and integrated into the team.
