The process begins when a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian.  Upon receiving the call, the room-service manager records the order details. Following this, the room-service manager creates and submits an order ticket to the kitchen to initiate food preparation. Concurrently, the room-service manager creates and submits a separate order to the sommelier for any alcoholic beverages requested. This sommelier order involves retrieving the requested wine (or other alcoholic beverage) from the cellar and preparing it for service.  There is an exclusive choice based on the guest's order between submitting an order to the sommelier (80% of cases) or bypassing this step.  Simultaneously, while the kitchen and sommelier (if an order was placed) are fulfilling their respective tasks, the room-service manager assigns the order to a waiter. The waiter then begins preparing a cart for delivery, which involves placing a tablecloth on the cart and gathering the necessary silverware.  The waiter also gathers any non-alcoholic beverages included in the guest’s order.  Once the kitchen has completed the food preparation, the sommelier (if an order was placed) has prepared the alcoholic beverages, and the waiter has completed the cart setup and gathered non-alcoholic beverages, the waiter loads the food, beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), and any necessary accompaniments onto the cart and delivers it to the guest’s room.  After delivering the order, the waiter returns to the room-service station.  There is an exclusive choice for the waiter upon returning to the room-service station: either debit the guest’s account immediately, or if the waiter has another order to prepare or deliver, postpone the billing until those tasks are completed.  Once the current order or delivery tasks are completed, the waiter debits the guest's account for the original room service order.
