The process begins with the definition of marketing campaign objectives. This involves specifying the target audience and establishing measurable goals, such as lead generation targets or desired increases in brand awareness. Following objective definition, the marketing team proceeds with content creation, visual design development, and channel selection. Channel selection involves choosing from options such as digital advertising platforms, email marketing systems, and social media channels.  After content creation, design, and channel selection are complete, the campaign is launched.  Upon launch, real-time performance tracking is initiated. This tracking utilizes various metrics, including click-through rates, conversion rates, and other relevant indicators.  Concurrently with campaign execution, leads generated by the campaign are collected and integrated into the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This enables sales teams to access and follow up on these leads. The campaign continues until the pre-defined campaign period ends.  At the conclusion of the campaign period, a comprehensive performance analysis is conducted.  This analysis leverages the collected performance data and aims to identify areas for optimization in future marketing campaigns.  The process then concludes.
