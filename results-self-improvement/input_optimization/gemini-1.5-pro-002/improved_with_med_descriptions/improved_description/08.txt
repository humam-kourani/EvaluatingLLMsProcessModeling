An incident report, such as a technical issue or a safety concern, is logged in a tracking system. Following the logging, the incident report is assigned to a responsible team. The assigned team investigates the incident by gathering information related to the reported incident. Based on the gathered information, the team identifies the root cause of the incident. After identifying the root cause, the team suggests corrective actions to address the root cause.  A solution, which can be a fix, training, or a policy update, is implemented based on the suggested corrective actions.  Following the implementation of the solution, a follow-up activity is performed to ensure that the issue will not recur.  If the follow-up confirms that the issue is resolved, the process proceeds to the closure of the incident report in the tracking system. Finally, stakeholders are notified about the closure of the incident report.
