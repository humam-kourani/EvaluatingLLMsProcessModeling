The process begins when a company initiates a compliance audit scheduling activity, specifying the target standard (e.g., ISO, safety, or environmental regulations). Following scheduling, internal teams perform a preparation phase, which includes gathering necessary documentation and evidence, and conducting a self-assessment of their compliance with the specified standard.  This preparation phase concludes with a documented self-assessment report. Subsequently, external auditors perform a review of the company's processes and documentation, producing a report that identifies any gaps or non-conformities.  If gaps are identified, the company performs a corrective action phase to address the identified non-conformities detailed in the auditor's report.  After the corrective actions are completed, the company undergoes a final audit conducted by the external auditors. Based on the results of the final audit, an exclusive gateway determines whether the company is compliant. If compliant, a certification is awarded to the company.  Following certification award, official documentation of the certification is issued to the company, marking the end of the process. If the company is found non-compliant in the final audit, the process concludes without certification, and the company may choose to initiate a new compliance audit scheduling activity after taking necessary corrective actions.
