The process begins when a customer submits an order, either through the online platform or via a phone call.  Following order submission, the system automatically generates and sends an order confirmation to the customer containing order details.  Upon receipt of the order information, the warehouse team initiates the fulfillment process. This involves retrieving the ordered items from inventory (picking), packaging the items securely (packing), and generating a shipping label containing the customer's address and tracking information.  The packaged order, along with the generated shipping label, is then handed over to a designated logistics provider.  Subsequently, the tracking information is relayed to the customer, enabling them to monitor the shipment's progress.  The system actively monitors the shipment's status throughout the delivery process. Upon confirmation of successful delivery, the core order fulfillment process concludes.  However,  a subsequent process may be triggered based on customer feedback or the initiation of a return.  These post-delivery actions are treated as separate processes initiated by the customer.
