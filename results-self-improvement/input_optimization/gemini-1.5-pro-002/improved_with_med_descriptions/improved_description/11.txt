The process begins when a customer initiates a signup procedure, providing personal information and payment details.  Upon submission of these details, the system creates a new customer account, grants the customer access to the subscribed services, and schedules recurring billing cycles based on the chosen subscription plan.  During the active subscription period, the customer receives regular updates, which may include product improvements, new feature announcements, or renewal alerts. If the customer decides to cancel their subscription, they submit a cancellation request.  Upon receipt of this request, the support team reviews the request and initiates the cancellation procedure, which includes calculating and applying any applicable refunds or outstanding charges.  Following the cancellation procedure, the system deactivates the customer's account and performs a final balance settlement, ensuring all outstanding payments are processed and any remaining credit is refunded. The process concludes once the account is deactivated and the final balance is settled.
