The process begins with the identification of a new product idea or a product improvement opportunity.  Following identification, the R&D team conducts initial research to assess the viability of the idea/improvement.  Subsequently, feasibility studies are performed to evaluate technical and economic feasibility.  If the feasibility studies are positive, the R&D team proceeds to draft multiple design concepts.  From these concepts, a single design is selected through a decision-making process. The selected design then enters the prototyping phase, where a prototype is constructed utilizing available resources.  Following prototype construction, the prototype undergoes a series of tests to evaluate its functionality, safety, and market potential.  The test results are then analyzed. Based on the analysis of the test results, a decision is made: if the feedback from testing indicates the need for refinements, the prototype is refined and the testing process is repeated. This loop of refinement and testing continues until the test results are satisfactory.  If the test results are satisfactory, or if at any point the prototype is deemed unsuitable for further development, the process concludes. The final outcome is either approval of the prototype for further development or its rejection, leading to discontinuation.
