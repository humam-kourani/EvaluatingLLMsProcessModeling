The process begins when a customer submits a complaint regarding a product or service.  Upon submission, customer service logs the complaint and categorizes it based on the product or service in question.  The complaint is then assigned to the appropriate department based on this categorization for investigation. The assigned team assesses the complaint's validity based on pre-defined criteria and determines whether a refund is warranted. Following this assessment, the customer is notified of the decision.  There is an exclusive gateway based on the refund decision: If the refund is approved, the complaint information along with the approval decision is forwarded to the financial team, who then processes the reimbursement.  Upon successful completion of the reimbursement, the status of the complaint is updated to "Resolved". If the refund is rejected, the customer receives a notification detailing the reasons for the rejection, and the status of the complaint is also updated to "Resolved". After the complaint is marked as "Resolved", the customer is given the opportunity to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the complaint resolution process.
