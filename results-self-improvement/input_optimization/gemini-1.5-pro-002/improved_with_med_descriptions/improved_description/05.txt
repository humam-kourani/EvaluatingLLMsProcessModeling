The process begins when a company identifies a need for a new supplier.  This triggers the procurement team to initiate the supplier selection process. The procurement team then develops and issues a Request for Proposal (RFP) outlining specific requirements and criteria.  Upon receiving supplier responses to the RFP, the procurement team reviews and evaluates each submission based on predefined criteria including cost, quality, and delivery time.  An exclusive choice is made for each prospective supplier regarding conducting a site visit and/or interview. Following this evaluation and any subsequent site visits or interviews, a comprehensive analysis of the remaining candidates is performed. Based on this analysis, a preferred supplier is selected. Next, contract negotiations are initiated between the company and the chosen supplier.  These negotiations encompass various terms and conditions.  If an agreement is reached on all terms, the contract is signed by both parties.  If no agreement is reached, the process may return to the supplier selection phase. Following contract signing, the supplier onboarding process is initiated, which involves integrating the new supplier into the company's systems and processes.  Finally, the contract execution phase begins, marking the ongoing relationship with the new supplier and fulfilling the initial need.
