The process begins when a department initiates a request by outlining their objectives, such as hiring new personnel, acquiring new equipment, or undertaking marketing campaigns.  The requesting department then drafts a detailed plan which includes specific cost estimates for each objective and justifications for the requested resources. This plan is then submitted for review in a strategic meeting.  In this meeting, the plan is evaluated against organizational goals and strategic priorities. Following the strategic review, the finance department assesses the budget feasibility of the plan. This assessment considers available funds and overall financial constraints.  Based on the finance department's assessment, adjustments to the plan may be required.  For each adjustment made, a detailed record of the change is created and documented. These documented changes are then submitted to relevant stakeholders for their approval. This cycle of adjustment, documentation, and stakeholder approval repeats until the plan is deemed financially feasible and strategically aligned. Upon receiving final approval from all stakeholders, the budget is formally allocated to the requesting department.  The process concludes with the department commencing the implementation of the approved plan.
