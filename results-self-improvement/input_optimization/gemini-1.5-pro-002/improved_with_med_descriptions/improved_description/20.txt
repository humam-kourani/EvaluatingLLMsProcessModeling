The process begins when a guest calls room service. Upon receiving the call, the room-service manager records the guest's order in detail, including specific items and any special requests.  The manager then sends an order ticket to the kitchen, initiating the food preparation process.  Concurrently, the room-service manager checks the order for alcoholic beverages. If the order includes alcohol (which occurs in 80% of cases), the manager instructs the sommelier to retrieve the specified wine from the cellar and prepare any other alcoholic beverages included in the order. If the order does not contain alcohol, this step is skipped.  Next, the room-service manager assigns the order to an available waiter. After receiving the assignment, the waiter begins preparing a service cart. This involves selecting an appropriate tablecloth and arranging the necessary silverware. The waiter also prepares any non-alcoholic beverages included in the order.  Meanwhile, the kitchen staff prepares the food according to the order ticket and the sommelier (if involved) prepares the alcoholic beverages. Once the food, alcoholic beverages (if applicable), and non-alcoholic beverages are ready, and the waiter has completed the cart setup, the waiter collects the prepared items and beverages from the kitchen and sommelier (if applicable) and loads them onto the prepared cart.  The waiter then delivers the cart to the guest’s room. Following the delivery, the waiter debits the guest’s account for the room service charges.  In cases where the waiter is attending to another order, the debiting process may be delayed until the waiter is available.
