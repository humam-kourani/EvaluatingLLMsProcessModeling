The process begins with the identification of an idea for a new product or an improvement to an existing product.  Following the idea identification, the R&D team conducts initial research to assess the feasibility of the idea.  This research includes market analysis, technology assessment, and cost estimation. Based on the research findings, a feasibility study is conducted to determine the viability of the idea.  If the idea is deemed feasible, the R&D team proceeds to the design phase. The design phase involves drafting multiple design concepts, considering various factors like functionality, aesthetics, and manufacturability.  These design concepts are then evaluated against pre-defined criteria, and a promising design is selected.  After a design is selected, the prototyping phase begins.  This phase involves building a prototype using available materials and resources.  The constructed prototype then undergoes a series of tests, which include functionality testing to verify its performance, safety testing to ensure it meets safety standards, and market potential testing to assess its acceptance among target customers. The results from these tests are collected and analyzed.  Based on the test results, there is an exclusive choice: either the prototype is deemed satisfactory, or it requires refinement. If refinement is required, the prototype is modified, and the testing phase is repeated. This iterative cycle of refinement and testing continues until the prototype meets the required standards.  Finally, the process concludes with a decision: either the prototype is approved for further development, or it is discarded based on the overall evaluation.
