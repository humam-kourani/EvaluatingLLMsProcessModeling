An e-commerce company's order fulfillment process begins when a customer places an order, triggering the system to record the order details.  Subsequently, payment processing is initiated.  There is an exclusive choice based on the payment outcome: If the payment fails, the customer is notified, and the order fulfillment process terminates. If the payment is successful, the process proceeds to inventory verification. The inventory system checks the availability of all ordered items.  If any item is out of stock, a back-order is initiated for that item, and the customer is notified about the potential delay. The fulfillment process for that item resumes once the back-ordered item is received and becomes available in stock.  For items in stock, the picking process from the warehouse is initiated. Following picking, quality control checks are performed on the picked items.  Packaging of the picked and checked items is then carried out, including an exclusive choice for gift wrapping based on the customer's request during order placement. Concurrently with picking and packaging, the shipping department prepares the shipping documents and labels.  Furthermore, there is an exclusive choice based on the order's destination: if the order is international, customs documentation is prepared. Once both the packaging process and the preparation of shipping documents (including any customs documentation) are completed, the order is dispatched. Upon dispatch, the system sends a shipping confirmation to the customer.  After dispatch, the system updates the inventory levels for the dispatched items.  After the customer receives the order, a follow-up email requesting feedback is sent to the customer.  There is an exclusive choice following delivery based on customer feedback: If the customer reports any issues, a returns process is initiated. This returns process includes sending a return shipping label to the customer, receiving the returned items, inspecting the returned items, and finally processing either a refund or a replacement depending on the nature of the returned items and customer preference.
