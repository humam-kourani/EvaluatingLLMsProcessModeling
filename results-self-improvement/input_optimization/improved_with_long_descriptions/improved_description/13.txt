The process begins when a customer submits a complaint regarding a specific product or service.  Customer service logs the complaint, recording all relevant details such as customer information, product/service involved, and the nature of the complaint. The complaint is then assigned to the appropriate department based on the complaint's nature. The assigned department reviews the complaint details and supporting documentation. Following the review, the team makes a decision regarding the complaint's validity.  If the complaint is deemed valid, the team then determines whether a refund is justified. The customer is notified of the decision, including the justification for approval or rejection of the refund.  If the refund is approved, the complaint details and approval decision are forwarded to the financial team. The financial team processes the reimbursement, which includes verifying the customer's payment information and initiating the refund transaction.  If the refund is successfully processed, the complaint is marked as resolved. If the refund is rejected, the complaint is marked as resolved immediately after notifying the customer of the decision. After the complaint resolution, the customer is given the opportunity to provide feedback on their experience with the complaint handling process.
