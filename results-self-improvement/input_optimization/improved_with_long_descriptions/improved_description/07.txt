This process begins when a customer initiates a search for a travel ticket, specifying the desired mode of transport (flight, train, or bus).  The customer then selects a preferred route from the available options, along with the desired travel date and time. Following route selection, the customer is required to provide personal information, including but not limited to name and contact details.  Subsequently, the customer enters payment details through a secure payment gateway. Upon successful payment verification, the booking system generates a travel ticket. This ticket is then transmitted to the customer electronically, either via email or SMS, based on the customer's preference or system defaults.  Concurrently, the travel company's seat inventory database is updated to reflect the confirmed booking, reducing the available seats for the selected route. In the period leading up to the travel date, the customer may receive automated reminders containing important travel information, check-in instructions, and/or boarding procedures.  The core travel booking process concludes once the customer completes their journey. However, the overall process may be extended by optional post-travel activities, such as the customer providing feedback or utilizing post-travel services offered by the travel company.
