This process begins with a department outlining its objectives for the upcoming period, such as hiring new personnel, specifying required equipment, or detailing planned marketing efforts. The department's team then drafts a detailed plan which incorporates these objectives. This plan includes specific cost estimates for each objective and provides justifications for the total budget requested. The drafted plan is then subjected to a strategic alignment review meeting where stakeholders evaluate its alignment with the broader organizational goals.  Following the strategic alignment review, the finance department conducts a detailed financial review to assess the budget's feasibility and sustainability. Based on feedback from both the strategic alignment review and the financial review, the plan may undergo several iterations of revisions and adjustments.  Each individual adjustment made to the plan is documented and requires approval from the relevant stakeholders.  Once the final version of the budget plan receives the necessary approvals, the budget is formally allocated to the department. The process concludes when the allocated budget is fully distributed to the department, and the department initiates the implementation of the approved plan.
