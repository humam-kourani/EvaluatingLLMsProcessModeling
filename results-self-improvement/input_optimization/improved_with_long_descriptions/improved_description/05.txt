The process begins when a company identifies the need for a new supplier or vendor.  The procurement team then initiates the process by issuing a request for proposals (RFP), specifying requirements and evaluation criteria such as cost, quality, delivery time, and other relevant factors.  Upon receiving responses from various suppliers, each proposal undergoes a detailed evaluation process. This evaluation includes a comparison against the pre-defined criteria in the RFP.  In parallel to proposal evaluation, the procurement team may choose to conduct site visits and/or interviews with potential suppliers to gather additional information and assess their capabilities.  Following the evaluation, a decision gateway is encountered where the procurement team selects a preferred supplier based on the comprehensive assessment.  Subsequently, contract negotiations begin with the selected supplier.  This negotiation process involves iterative discussions and revisions of terms until a mutual agreement is reached.  If an agreement is reached, the contract is signed by both parties. If no agreement can be reached, the process may return to the supplier selection stage, and an alternative supplier may be chosen. Once the contract is signed, the supplier onboarding process commences, involving necessary administrative tasks and system integrations.  The process concludes when the supplier is officially onboarded, the contract is fully executed, and the supplier is authorized to commence providing goods or services.
