This process begins with the identification of an employee's development needs and career aspirations.  Following the identification, the employee's manager and a Human Resources representative collaborate to create a personalized development plan. This plan may include recommendations for training programs, mentorship opportunities, or the assignment of additional responsibilities.  The employee then begins working on enhancing the identified skills. During this skill enhancement period, the employee receives regular feedback and performance evaluations from their direct supervisor. This feedback loop continues until pre-defined milestones, outlined in the development plan, are achieved. Once these milestones are met, the employee becomes eligible for consideration for a promotion or a new role. At this point, Human Resources conducts a formal review of the employee's performance against the established milestones. There is an exclusive choice based on the outcome of this review: either the promotion is approved, or the promotion is denied. If approved, the promotion is finalized, which includes defining new responsibilities and adjusting compensation accordingly.  The process concludes when the employee is officially promoted and fully transitions into their new role.
