This process begins when an employee or a customer submits an incident report detailing a technical issue, a workplace safety concern, or another relevant incident type.  The submitted report is then logged into a designated tracking system, and based on the incident type, the report is assigned to the appropriate team responsible for investigation. The assigned team gathers all necessary information related to the incident, including but not limited to interviews, system logs, and physical evidence.  Following the information gathering, the team analyzes the gathered information to identify the root cause of the reported incident. Based on the root cause analysis, the team proposes and documents one or more corrective actions to address the identified issue. The chosen corrective action, which may involve a system fix, employee training, a policy change, or a combination of these, is then implemented.  After the implementation of the corrective action is completed, a follow-up review is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the implemented solution and to ensure that the original incident will not recur.  If the follow-up review determines the incident is resolved, the incident report is formally closed in the tracking system, and all involved stakeholders, including the initial reporter, are notified of the closure and resolution. If the follow-up review is unsuccessful, the process loops back to the corrective action identification stage. The process concludes when the incident report is formally closed, and all stakeholders are notified.
