The audit process begins when the audit coordinator sends a notification to the regional office, initiating the audit. Upon receiving the notification, the regional office prepares the financial statements and gathers all necessary supporting documents.  Simultaneously, the compliance team checks for any regulatory updates that could impact the current audit. Following the collection of documents and regulatory review, the regional office submits the compiled documentation to the central audit team. The central audit team then reviews the submitted documents.  If any discrepancies are identified during the review, the central audit team requests clarifications from the regional office. The regional office then provides the requested clarifications to the central audit team. This clarification process repeats until no further discrepancies remain. When the central audit teamâ€™s review is complete and no discrepancies remain, the audit team proceeds to conduct a risk assessment. The risk assessment consists of three parallel evaluations: financial risk, operational risk, and compliance risk.  After all three risk evaluations are completed, the results are consolidated. If the consolidated risk assessment identifies any high-risk areas, a detailed investigation is launched. The detailed investigation may include data analysis, interviews, and optionally, site visits. Once all identified risks have been addressed, the audit team compiles a comprehensive audit report. The compiled audit report is then submitted to the audit director for review. The audit director reviews the report and makes a decision: either approve the report or request revisions. If the audit director requests revisions, the audit team updates the report according to the feedback and resubmits the revised report to the audit director for another review. This review and revision cycle continues until the audit director approves the report. Upon approval by the audit director, the final approved audit report is distributed to the executive board and archived for future reference. Following distribution and archival, the entire audit process is formally closed.
