This process begins when a customer submits an order either through the online platform or via a phone call.  Upon order submission, the system automatically generates an order confirmation and sends this confirmation to the customer via email (for online orders) or SMS message (for phone orders). The warehouse team receives a notification of the new order and proceeds to pick the ordered items from the inventory.  Following item picking, the warehouse team packs the items securely for shipment, and a shipping label, containing the customer's address and tracking information, is generated. The packaged order, along with the generated shipping label, is then handed over to a designated logistics provider.  After handover, the logistics provider scans the shipping label into their system, initiating the delivery process. The customer receives an email or SMS message containing the tracking information, enabling them to monitor the shipment's progress. The system actively monitors the shipment's status via updates from the logistics provider. Upon confirmation of successful delivery to the customer's specified address, the primary order fulfillment process is considered complete.  Following delivery, there is a possibility that the customer may submit feedback or initiate a return.  If customer feedback is received, it is logged and processed. If a customer initiates a return, a separate return process is triggered.
