The process begins when a company initiates a compliance audit scheduling activity, specifying the target regulations (e.g., ISO standards, safety protocols, environmental guidelines). Following the scheduling, internal teams perform a series of preparatory activities, including documentation preparation, evidence gathering, and conducting a self-assessment. These preparatory activities occur before the external audit.  Subsequently, external auditors conduct a review of the company's processes, identifying any gaps or issues. Based on the auditors' findings, the company performs corrective actions or implements improvements.  After the corrective actions/improvements are completed, the company undergoes a final audit conducted by the external auditors.  Following the final audit, there is an exclusive gateway based on whether the audit criteria are met. If the criteria are met, the company is awarded certification, followed by the issuance of official documents, after which the process ends. If the criteria are not met, the process loops back to the corrective actions/improvements stage.
