The process begins with the identification of an employee's development needs and career goals. This identification may be initiated by the employee, the manager, or HR.  Following this, the manager and HR collaborate to create a personalized development plan. This plan details specific activities aimed at addressing the identified needs and goals. These activities may include training courses, mentorship programs, or assignments of new responsibilities. The employee then actively works on developing the identified skills and achieving the objectives outlined in the development plan. During this period, the employee receives regular feedback from their supervisor(s) to monitor progress and provide guidance.  When pre-defined milestones within the development plan are met, the employee becomes eligible for consideration for a promotion.  At this point, HR conducts a formal performance review, assessing the employee's progress, achievements, and overall suitability for promotion. There is a decision gateway based on the performance review: if the review is positive and the employee is deemed ready for promotion, HR proceeds to finalize the promotion. This finalization includes updating the employee's job title, responsibilities, and compensation. If the review outcome is negative, the employee continues working on their development plan. The process concludes with the employee transitioning into their new role, if the promotion is approved, or continuing in their current role with a revised development plan.
