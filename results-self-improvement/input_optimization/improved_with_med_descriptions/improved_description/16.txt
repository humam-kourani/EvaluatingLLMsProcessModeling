The annual audit process is initiated when the audit coordinator sends a notification to the regional office. Upon receiving the notification, the regional office prepares the financial statements and gathers the necessary documents. Concurrently, the compliance team checks for any updates to relevant regulations. Following document preparation and gathering, the regional office submits the compiled documents to the central audit team. The central audit team reviews the submitted documents.  If clarifications are required, the central audit team requests these from the regional office. The regional office then provides the requested clarifications to the central audit team.  After all clarifications are received, the central audit team conducts a risk assessment. This risk assessment encompasses financial risk, operational risk, and compliance risk, and these individual risk assessments can be conducted in any order.  Following the risk assessment, there is an exclusive choice based on the findings. If high-risk findings are identified, a detailed investigation is initiated. This detailed investigation may involve data analysis, interviews, and, conditionally, site visits. If no high-risk findings are identified, the detailed investigation is skipped.  After the completion of any detailed investigations, the audit team compiles a report. This compiled report is then submitted to the audit director for review. The audit director reviews the report and makes an exclusive decision to either approve the report or send it back to the audit team for revisions. If the report is sent back for revisions, the audit team revises the report and resubmits it to the audit director for review. This review and revision cycle continues until the audit director approves the report. Upon approval by the audit director, the report is distributed to the executive board and archived.  Following these actions, the annual audit process is formally closed.
