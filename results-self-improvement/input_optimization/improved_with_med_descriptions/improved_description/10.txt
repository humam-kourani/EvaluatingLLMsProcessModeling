The process begins when a user submits a formal request for an IT solution, specifying the required software or hardware.  Upon receiving the request, the IT department initiates an assessment process which involves verifying the solution's compatibility with existing systems, estimating the associated costs, and evaluating the available resources (personnel, budget, infrastructure). Following the assessment, a decision gateway determines whether the request is approved or rejected. If approved, the IT department proceeds with the procurement of the requested solution. Once procured, the solution undergoes an installation process in a dedicated and controlled testing environment. Subsequent to installation, the solution is thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and performance.  If the testing is successful, the solution is deployed and rolled out to the requesting department.  Concurrently with the rollout,  training is provided to the end-users, and ongoing technical support is made available to address any arising issues or questions. If the testing is unsuccessful, the IT department revisits the initial request and may propose alternative solutions.  If the request is rejected, the user is notified with a justification for the rejection.
