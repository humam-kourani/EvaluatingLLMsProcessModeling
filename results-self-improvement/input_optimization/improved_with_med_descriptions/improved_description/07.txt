The process begins when a customer initiates a search for a travel ticket, specifying desired criteria such as route, date, and time.  Upon finding a suitable option, the customer proceeds to select the desired ticket. Subsequently, the customer is required to provide personal information and payment details through a secure interface.  Following successful payment verification, the booking system generates a travel ticket. The generated ticket is then transmitted to the customer via email or SMS. Concurrently, the company's seat inventory database is updated to reflect the booking.  Prior to the commencement of the journey, the customer may receive reminders and instructions related to check-in procedures and boarding. These communications are conditional and may not be sent in all cases. After the customer completes their journey, the process enters its final stage. In this stage, the customer is given the opportunity to provide feedback regarding their travel experience.  Additionally, post-travel services may be offered to the customer. The process concludes after the feedback and service offering stage.
