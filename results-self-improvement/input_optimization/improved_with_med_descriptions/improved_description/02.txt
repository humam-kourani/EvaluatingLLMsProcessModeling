When a department identifies a hiring need, they submit a formal hiring request to HR, specifying the required role, responsibilities, and qualifications.  HR then drafts a job description based on this request and posts it on relevant job boards and the company website.  Applications received in response to the job posting are screened against the defined qualifications.  Shortlisted candidates are contacted for initial phone screenings to assess basic suitability and interest.  Based on the phone screening results, a subset of candidates is chosen to participate in further in-person or virtual interviews, which include assessments related to technical skills, cultural fit, and experience.  Following the interviews, the hiring team evaluates all candidates and selects the most suitable one. A formal job offer, including salary and benefits details, is extended to the selected candidate. This may involve a negotiation process to finalize the compensation package.  If the candidate accepts the offer, the onboarding process begins. This process includes completing necessary paperwork, attending orientation sessions to familiarize the new hire with company policies and culture, and participating in role-specific training programs.  The onboarding process is considered complete when all required paperwork is finalized, orientation is attended, and training is completed.  At this point, the new hire is formally integrated into the team and begins their regular duties.  The hiring process concludes upon successful integration of the new hire.
