The university enrollment process begins when a prospective student submits an application online.  Following submission, the application is reviewed by the admissions office.  If the application is missing required documents, the applicant is notified and given an opportunity to submit the missing items. This process repeats until the application is deemed complete.  Once complete, the application undergoes a parallel evaluation process: the admissions committee assesses the application based on academic criteria, while concurrently, the finance department processes the application fee.  Based on the admissions committee's evaluation, an exclusive choice is made:  If the applicant is accepted, an acceptance letter is generated and sent to the applicant. Alternatively, if the applicant is rejected, a rejection letter is sent.  Accepted applicants must then confirm their enrollment by a specified deadline.  Failure to confirm enrollment by the deadline results in automatic cancellation of the acceptance.  Upon confirmation of enrollment, the process forks into two parallel paths: orientation materials are sent to the student, and concurrently, student accounts are created for university resources including email, student portals, and library access.  For international students, an additional step of visa assistance is provided.  Following account creation, the student obtains a university ID card, meets with an academic advisor, selects courses for the upcoming semester, and resolves any scheduling conflicts.  Once these pre-semester activities are completed, the student may begin attending classes.  At the start of each semester, there is an add/drop period during which students may adjust their course selections. Throughout the semester, students can view their grades online. If a student encounters an issue, they have the option to file a grievance. This semester-based cycle of course selection, attendance, grade viewing, and optional grievance filing continues until the student graduates or withdraws from the university.
