The process begins with continuous monitoring of inventory levels for each product.  When the inventory level of a product reaches a pre-defined minimum threshold, an alert is generated and sent to the procurement team.  The procurement team initiates the supplier selection process, considering factors such as cost, estimated delivery time, and supplier reliability.  After a supplier is selected, a purchase order is created and sent to the chosen supplier.  Concurrently, the inventory system logs the expected delivery date and quantity for the ordered product. Upon receiving the shipment from the supplier, a quality check is performed on the delivered items. If the quality check passes, the received stock is recorded in the inventory system, and then physically stored in the designated warehouse location.  If the quality check fails, the shipment is returned to the supplier.  Finally, the inventory levels in the system are updated to reflect the received and stored stock, concluding the replenishment process.
