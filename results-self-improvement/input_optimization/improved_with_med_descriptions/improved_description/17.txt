The order fulfillment process of an e-commerce company begins when a customer places an order.  Upon order placement, the system records the order details such as items ordered, quantities, and shipping address.  Concurrently, the system processes the customer's payment.  There is an exclusive choice based on the payment outcome: If the payment fails, the customer is notified of the failure, and the order fulfillment process ends. If the payment is successful, the system checks inventory availability for each item in the order.  For each item, there is an exclusive choice: If an item is out of stock, a back-order is initiated for that item, and the customer is informed about the potential shipping delay.  This process is repeated for all items in the order.  If all items are in stock, the order proceeds to fulfillment. Warehouse staff retrieves the ordered items from inventory (picking). Subsequently, the picked items undergo a quality check. Following the quality check, the items are packaged.  If the customer requested gift wrapping during order placement, the items are gift-wrapped before being packaged.  Shipping documents and labels are then generated for the package.  If the order is being shipped internationally, customs forms are also prepared and included. After the package is prepared, it is dispatched for shipping.  Simultaneously, the system updates the inventory levels to reflect the shipped items and sends a shipping confirmation email to the customer. Upon successful delivery of the order to the customer, the system triggers a feedback request email to be sent to the customer.  If the customer reports any issues with the order after delivery, a returns process is initiated. The returns process involves generating a return shipping label for the customer, receiving and inspecting the returned item(s), and then processing either a refund or a replacement depending on the nature of the issue and customer preference.
