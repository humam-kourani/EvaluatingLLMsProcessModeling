The process begins when a potential customer initiates an inquiry regarding a product or service.  Sales staff then gather information about the customer's needs and address any questions the customer may have.  Following this information gathering stage, there is an exclusive choice: if the customer expresses further interest, the process proceeds; otherwise, the process terminates.  If the customer is interested, sales staff assist the customer in selecting the appropriate product or service based on their previously gathered needs. Subsequently, the sales representative generates a quote for the selected product or service.  Upon receiving the quote, the customer makes a decision: either they approve the quote, or they do not.  If the customer approves the quote, the sales representative places the order. Following order placement, the order details are recorded in the system. Finally, the customer receives an order confirmation, after which the process concludes.  If the customer does not approve the quote, the process terminates.
