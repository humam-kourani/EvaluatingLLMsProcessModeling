To purchase from an online shop, the user first logs in.  Following successful login, the user selects desired items and concurrently sets a preferred payment method. After item selection, and independent of the payment process, the user chooses a free reward based on the total value of the selected items.  Following item selection and payment method setting, the user proceeds to payment. There is an exclusive choice between paying in full or arranging an installment plan.  After successful payment, the selected items are delivered to the user.  Following delivery, there is an exclusive choice for the user to either initiate a return for exchange or keep the delivered items. If the user initiates a return, a new delivery of the exchanged items is triggered.  This return and redelivery process can be repeated multiple times.
