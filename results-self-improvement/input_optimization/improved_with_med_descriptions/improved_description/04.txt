The process begins with the activity of setting campaign objectives. This involves defining specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, such as lead generation, brand awareness, or increased sales.  Concurrently, the target audience is identified based on demographics, interests, and behavior.  Following objective setting and audience identification, the marketing team develops content tailored to the target audience and campaign objectives. This includes writing copy, creating multimedia content, and designing visuals. Simultaneously, appropriate promotion channels are selected from options such as digital ads (including search, display, and social media advertising), email marketing, social media organic posts, and/or traditional media. After content development and channel selection are complete, the campaign is launched across the chosen channels. During the campaign's active period, real-time tracking of key performance indicators (KPIs) is performed.  These KPIs include, but are not limited to, click-through rates, conversion rates, impressions, and reach.  As leads are generated during the campaign, they are captured and stored within the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. These leads are then passed on to the sales team for follow-up and qualification.  After the campaign has concluded, a performance analysis is conducted. This analysis evaluates the campaign's effectiveness against the pre-defined objectives and identifies areas for improvement in future campaigns.  The process ends with the documentation of these findings and recommendations for optimization.
